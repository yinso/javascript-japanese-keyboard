Javascript Japanese Keyboard (hereinafter referred to as JJK) is a single kanji conversion system.

This system covers JIS Level 1 kanji.(Strictly speaking,dictionary data covers it.)

The target browsers are 3DS browser and Chrome and Firefox.
(Probably chrome needs using "--allow-file-access-from-files" option.)

Currently only mouse operation is available on sample.
